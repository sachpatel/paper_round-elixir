Assumptions
============

- House numbers can be represented by integer values. House names e.g. "1A" are not allowed.
- The street layout input may not have an ordered set of housenumbers along a street (application will handle this)
- An empty file provided to the application is invalid such that the application errors.
- An incorrectly formed file is also an invalid file but will be checked to inform user of the issue.
- The file input could have layouts for multiple streets in a neighbourhood, thus the application will treat each line entry in the input file as a separate street.
- The input street house numbers can be comma delimited.


Additional Notes
=================

- Created application can be run using mix run \lib\paper_round.exs.
- Used Elixir ExUnit test framework for writing unit tests.
- Tests for the first User Story are in the test\street_plan_test.ex file.
- Tests for the second User Story are in the test\delivery_approach_one_test.ex and test\delivery_approach_one_two.ex files.
